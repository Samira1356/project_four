       "  \"Business software or a business application is any software or set of computer programs used by business users to perform various business functions. These business applications are used to increase productivity, to measure productivity and to perform other business functions accurately.\\nBy and large, business software is likely to be developed to meet the needs of a specific business, and therefore is not easily transferable to a different business environment, unless its nature and operation is identical. Due to the unique requirements of each business, off-the-shelf software is unlikely to completely address a company's needs. However, where an on-the-shelf solution is necessary, due to time or monetary considerations, some level of customization is likely to be required. Exceptions do exist, depending on the business in question, and thorough research is always required before committing to bespoke or off-the-shelf solutions.\\nSome business applications are interactive, i.e., they have a graphical user interface or user interface and users can query/modify/input data and view results instantaneously. They can also run reports instantaneously. Some business applications run in batch mode: they are set up to run based on a predetermined event/time and a business user does not need to initiate them or monitor them.\\nSome business applications are built in-house and some are bought from vendors (off the shelf software products). These business applications are installed on either desktops or big servers. Prior to the introduction of COBOL (a universal compiler) in 1965, businesses developed their own unique machine language. RCA's language consisted of a 12-position instruction. For example, to read a record into memory, the first two digits would be the instruction (action) code. The next four positions of the instruction (an 'A' address) would be the exact leftmost memory location where you want the readable character to be placed. Four positions (a 'B' address) of the instruction would note the very rightmost memory location where you want the last character of the record to be located. A two digit 'B' address also allows a modification of any instruction. Instruction codes and memory designations excluded the use of 8's or 9's. The first RCA business application was implemented in 1962 on a 4k RCA 301. The RCA 301, mid frame 501, and large frame 601 began their marketing in early 1960.\\nMany kinds of users are found within the business environment, and can be categorized by using a small, medium and large matrix:\\nThe small business market generally consists of home accounting software, and office suites such as OpenOffice.org or Microsoft Office.\\nThe medium size, or small and medium-sized enterprise (SME), has a broader range of software applications, ranging from accounting, groupware, customer relationship management, human resource management systems, outsourcing relationship management, loan origination software, shopping cart software, field service software, and other productivity enhancing applications.\\nThe last segment covers enterprise level software applications, such as those in the fields of enterprise resource planning, enterprise content management (ECM), business process management (BPM) and product lifecycle management. These applications are extensive in scope, and often come with modules that either add native functions, or incorporate the functionality of third-party computer programs.\\nTechnologies that previously only existed in peer-to-peer software applications, like Kazaa and Napster, are starting to appear within business applications.\\n\\n\\n== Types of business tools ==\\nEnterprise application software (EAS)\\nResource Management\\nDigital dashboards, also known as business intelligence dashboards, enterprise dashboards, or executive dashboards. These are visually based summaries of business data that show at-a-glance understanding of conditions through metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs). Dashboards are a very popular tools that have arisen in the last few years.\\nOnline analytical processing (OLAP), (which include HOLAP, ROLAP and MOLAP) - are a capability of some management, decision support, and executive information systems that support interactive examination of large amounts of data from many perspectives.\\nReporting software generates aggregated views of data to keep the management informed about the state of their business.\\nProcurement software is business software that helps to automate the purchasing function of organizations.\\nData mining is the extraction of consumer information from a database by utilizing software that can isolate and identify previously unknown patterns or trends in large amounts of data. There is a variety of data mining techniques that reveal different types of patterns. Some of the techniques that belong here are statistical methods (particularly business statistics) and neural networks, as very advanced means of analyzing data.\\nBusiness performance management (BPM)\\nDocument management software is made for organizing and managing multiple documents of various types. Some of them have storage functions for security and back-up of valuable business information.\\nEmployee scheduling software- used for creating and distributing employee schedules, as well as for tracking employee hours.\\n\\n\\n== Brief history ==\\nThe essential motivation for business software is to increase profits by cutting costs or speeding the productive cycle. In the earliest days of white-collar business automation, large mainframe computers were used to tackle the most tedious jobs, like bank cheque clearing and factory accounting.\\nFactory accounting software was among the most popular of early business software tools, and included the automation of general ledgers, fixed assets inventory ledgers, cost accounting ledgers, accounts receivable ledgers, and accounts payable ledgers (including payroll, life insurance, health insurance, federal and state insurance and retirement).\\nThe early use of software to replace manual white-collar labor was extremely profitable, and caused a radical shift in white-collar labor. One computer might easily replace 100 white-collar 'pencil pushers', and the computer would not require any health or retirement benefits.\\nBuilding on these early successes with IBM, Hewlett-Packard and other early suppliers of business software solutions, corporate consumers demanded business software to replace the old-fashioned drafting board. CAD-CAM software (or computer-aided drafting for computer-aided manufacturing) arrived in the early 1980s. Also, project management software was so valued in the early 1980s that it might cost as much as $500,000 per copy (although such software typically had far fewer capabilities than modern project management software such as Microsoft Project, which one might purchase today for under $500 per copy.)\\nIn the early days, perhaps the most noticeable, widespread change in business software was the word processor. Because of its rapid rise, the ubiquitous IBM typewriter suddenly vanished in the 1980s as millions of companies worldwide shifted to the use of Word Perfect business software, and later, Microsoft Word software. Another vastly popular computer program for business were mathematical spreadsheet programs such as Lotus 1-2-3, and later Microsoft Excel.\\nIn the 1990s business shifted massively towards globalism with the appearance of SAP software which coordinates a supply-chain of vendors, potentially worldwide, for the most efficient, streamlined operation of factory manufacture.\\nYet nothing in the history of business software has had the global impact of the Internet, with its email and websites that now serve commercial interests worldwide. Globalism in business fully arrived when the Internet became a household word.\\nThe next phase in the evolution of business software is being led by the emergance of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), which involves identifying and automating highly repetitive tasks and processes, with an aim to drive operational efficiency, reduce costs and limit human error. Industries that have been in the forefront of RPA adoption include the Insurance industry, Banking and Financial Services, the Legal industry and the Healthcare industry.\\n\\n\\n== Application support ==\\nBusiness applications are built based on the requirements from the business users. Also, these business applications are built to use certain kind of Business transactions or data items. These business applications run flawlessly until there are no new business requirements or there is no change in underlying Business transactions. Also, the business applications run flawlessly if there are no issues with computer hardware, computer networks (Intenet/intranet), computer disks, power supplies, and various software components (middleware, database, computer programs, etc.).\\nBusiness applications can fail when an unexpected error occurs. This error could occur due to a data error (an unexpected data input or a wrong data input), an environment error (an in frastructure related error), a programming error, a human error or a work flow error. When a business application fails one needs to fix the business application error as soon as possible so that the business users can resume their work. This work of resolving business application errors is known as business application support.\\n\\n\\n=== Reporting errors ===\\nThe Business User calls the business application support team phone number or sends an e-mail to the business application support team. The business application support team gets all the details of the error from the business user on the phone or from the e-mail. These details are then entered in a tracking software. The tracking software creates a request number and this request number is given to the business user. This request number is used to track the progress on the support issue. The request is assigned to a support team member.\\n\\n\\n=== Notification of errors ===\\nFor critical business application errors (such as an application not available or an application not working correctly), an e-mail is sent to the entire organization or impacted teams so that they are aware of the issue. They are also provided with an estimated time for application availability.\\n\\n\\n=== Investigation or analysis of application errors ===\\nThe business application support team member collects all the necessary information about the business software error. This information is then recorded in the support request. All of the data used by the business user is also used in the investigation. The application program is reviewed for any possible programming errors.\\n\\n\\n=== Error resolution ===\\nIf any similar business application errors occurred in the past then the issue resolution steps are retrieved from the support knowledge base and the error is resolved using those steps. If it is a new support error, then new issue resolution steps are created and the error is resolved. The new support error resolution steps are recorded in the knowledge base for future use. For major business application errors (critical infrastructure or application failures), a phone conference call is initiated and all required support persons/teams join the call and they all work together to resolve the error.\\n\\n\\n=== Code correction ===\\nIf the business application error occurred due to programming errors, then a request is created for the application development team to correct programming errors. If the business user needs new features or functions in the business application, then the required analysis/design/programming/testing/release is planned and a new version of the business software is deployed.\\n\\n\\n=== Business process correction ===\\nIf the business application error occurred due to a work flow issue or human errors during data input, then the business users are notified. Business users then review their work flow and revise it if necessary. They also modify the user guide or user instructions to avoid such an error in the future.\\n\\n\\n=== Infrastructure issue correction ===\\nIf the business application error occurred due to infrastructure issues, then the specific infrastructure team is notified. The infrastructure team then implements permanent fixes for the issue and monitors the infrastructure to avoid the re-occurrence of the same error.\\n\\n\\n== Support follow up and internal reporting ==\\nThe business application error tracking system is used to review all issues periodically (daily, weekly and monthly) and reports are generated to monitor the resolved issues, repeating issues, and pending issues. Reports are also generated for the IT/IS management for improvement and management of business applications.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\",\n",

       "  'Active policy management is business-oriented enterprise software that provides an approach for efficiently and effectively addressing the many risks inherent in electronic communication. With the exponential growth in the use of electronic communication, many businesses are exposed to significant risks every day. These risks range from non-compliance with various regulations, to the leakage of intellectual property, and to inappropriate or offensive employee behavior. Active Policy Management enables a business to accurately detect the violations, to take the appropriate action (even blocking the message from being sent), and to quickly find and review the violation in order to address the situation, preventing further damage.\\nThere are many channels of electronic communication including e-mail, Web-based e-mail, instant messaging, messages sent from a Bloomberg terminal, mobile e-mail sent from a handheld device such as a BlackBerry, general use of a web browser, ftp, file copying (e.g. memory sticks) and many others.\\n\\n\\n== Electronic communication policy ==\\nThe key to effective detection of violations in electronic communication is policy. Policy for electronic communication defines who can send what to whom, and, if a violation is detected, what action to take. A policy is designed to address a specific issue or risk. Examples include:\\nCertain reports cannot be sent externally without a proper disclaimer being present\\nCertain employees cannot communicate about a business matter with other employees\\nDocuments intended for internal use only must not be sent to a recipient who is not a company employee\\nPolicy can only be effective at identifying violations if it can understand the true intent of a message. Policies based only on a list of words or a lexicon generally cannot perform this task.\\nFor any APM solution to be effective, it must have a proven technology to define and deploy accurate policy. And by “proven”, an interested party should inquire as to a particular solution’s successful installation at one or more customers.\\n\\n\\n== Application areas ==\\nAPM has three primary application areas. Real-Time Prevention, Intelligent Review, and Smart Tagging.\\nReal-Time Prevention can detect violations in electronic communication before a message has been sent (and before it has been delivered to an intended recipient). By doing this, a violation is prevented from having occurred. And, in the case where archive software is used, a message that has not been sent will not be ingested by an archive or be retrievable at a later date.\\nIntelligent Review can detect violations in electronic communication after a message has been sent. Intelligent Review also creates extremely targeted queues of messages that have a high likelihood of having violated an important corporate or regulatory policy. A reviewer or supervisor can easily access these relevant messages in order to thoroughly audit them. An audit can include flagging, exporting, approving, rejecting, and escalating a message.\\nSmart Tagging analyzes messages and assigns them to one or more categories. This categorization can be used for selective message archiving, to retain messages based on their content, and to enhance message retrieval for investigative purposes.\\n\\n\\n== Industry relevance ==\\nVirtually all businesses use electronic communication and are exposed to the inherent risks therein. Certain businesses are exposed to more risks than others. Heavily regulated industries such as financial services have a very strong need for APM. Industries where companies have many of their intellectual property assets in digital form would benefit from protecting those assets with APM. Other industries that would benefit from using APM include those where companies are concerned with corporate behavior and governance and those that use archive software to store messages for long periods of time, often for at least 3 years.\\n\\n\\n== See also ==\\nEnterprise software\\nRegulatory compliance\\nE-mail\\nSEC\\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority\\nNYSE\\nIntellectual property\\nArchive',\n",

Solocast was developed in 1998, which was software that allowed customers to do customer segmentation analysis.\\nIn 2000, SRC LLC entered into a contract with the U.S. Census Bureau that resulted in a modified version of its Allocate software being included on CD-ROMs of Census Data sold by the Bureau.\\nIn 2006, the software product Alteryx was released, which was a unified spatial and non-spatial data environment for building analytical processes and applications.\\nIn 2010, SRC LLC changed its name to that of its core product, Alteryx.\\nIn 2011, Alteryx raised $6 million in venture funding from the Palo Alto investment arm of SAP AG, SAP Ventures. In 2013, Alteryx raised $12 million from SAP Ventures and Toba Capital. In 2014, the company raised $60 million in Round B funding from Insight Venture Partners, SAP Ventures and Toba Capital, and announced plans for a 30% workforce expansion.\\nIn 2015, Iconiq Capital led a $85 million investment in Alteryx, with Insight Venture Partners and Meritech Capital Partners also participating. Alteryx announced plans to use the new capital to expand internationally, invest in research and development, and increase its sales and marketing efforts.\\nAlteryx announced in 2015 a new relationship with Microsoft in order to enable faster and easier data analysis through Power BI.\\nIn 2016, Alteryx was ranked #24 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.\\nOn March 24, 2017, Alteryx went public launching their IPO at the NYSE.\\n\\n\\n== Products ==\\nAlteryx currently offers three main products: Alteryx Designer, Alteryx Server and Alteryx Connect. Alteryx also hosts a cloud-based website known as the Alteryx Analytics Gallery.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nAlteryx website\\nAlteryx Analytics Gallery\",\n",

Currently all districts have signed a memorandum of understanding to voluntarily adopt BCeSIS on their own timeline. Support for schools and districts adopting the new system is provided by their own local staff resources in conjunction with Fujitsu Service Desk and the Ministry of Education. The Independent Schools of BC have pooled their resources as a consortium (the iGroup) and implementation/training and support of BCeSIS for Independent and First Nations School is handled by this consortium.\\n\\n\\n== Criticism ==\\n\\n\\n=== Social Criticism ===\\nSome teachers dislike the system, believing it to be a tool of social control, centralizing potentially sensitive private information, and placing important decisions about student education in the hands of unelected committees with no background in education.\\n\\n\\n=== Poor User Interface ===\\nThe system also draws criticism for its archaic user interface. Some screens within the program allow arrow key movement, some functions use icons or multi-level text clicks, others require mouse clicks. The general design was not field tested on its intended users, nor was it tested on multiple browsers, and resulted in a poor user experience. For example, fields containing parent phone numbers only display the part of the number; a mouse click and arrow clicks are required to see the rest. Students lists (a typical class consists of 24–30 students) shows only thirteen names on the screen; one has to scroll down for the rest. Marks entry encounters similar design faults: sideways scrolling within student field-sets are required to access the three types of data typically entered (percent, work habits, comment selection). Combined with a start-up beset with server problems the introduction of BCeSIS was met with sharp anxiety and a call to examine whether the system was worth the $80 million expenditure.\\nBCeSIS requires the use of outdated Java versions, as support for newer versions of Java was never implemented. There are many known serious security issues with the outdated version of Java required to run BCeSIS \\nUsing the Teacher Assistant interface, the teacher has access to the student demographics and contact information as well as details regarding the students\\' performance, programs and special education needs. BCeSIS gathers attendance in the classroom using an electronic attendance checklist and allows both the teacher and the office to share information regarding student absences. In an upcoming release of BCeSIS the province will be implementing a new capability called Parent Assistant that will allow parents to monitor their children\\'s attendance and performance as it is entered into the system.\\n\\n\\n== Media Attention ==\\nBCeSIS drew media attention in September 2010  for slow performance that hampered the efforts of schools to make timetable changes, process student transfers, and complete attendance. With new school district using the service, Fujitsu Service Desk was forced to limit the number of logins and post \"BCeSIS unavailable\" messages during peak usage hours. This compounded the performance issues and resulted in a number of internet parodies, including a re-subtitled scene from the movie Downfall.\\nOn September 19, 2011, The Vancouver Sun reported that the Ministry of Education would be discontinuing use of the BCeSIS software, based on a recommendation by Gartner, Inc, and would likely not have a replacement in place until 2014. The Minister of Education, George Abbott, said that the system had glitches but was still good value for money, and was being replaced largely because the technology was outdated.\\n\\n\\n== Future ==\\nBCeSIS is now being replaced by MyEducationBC. The first schools will be going live in September 2014. More information about implementation of MyEducationBC can be found at: http://sisimplementation.ca/\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== External links ==\\nBCeSIS Main Website\\nBCeSIS for Independent Schools\\nMyEducationBC for Independent Schools\\nhttp://fwix.com/vancouver/share/8283773e3f/give_us_back_our_bcesis_money_district_says\\ncreator of the software',\n",
